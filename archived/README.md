[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In%20Development-yellow.svg)](https://shields.io/)

## Overview

**Wild Strikes** is a fast-paced, turn-based strategy game that blends the chaotic projectile combat of *Wild Ones* with the strategic card-based mechanics of *Axie Infinity*. Control a team of unique warriors, each possessing distinct abilities and skill cards, and engage in action-packed battles where skill, planning, and a bit of luck determine the victor. Prepare for a tactical and engaging experience where every decision matters!

## Key Features

*   **Turn-Based Combat with a Twist:** Players take turns selecting and using skill cards to attack, move, and defend. But unlike traditional turn-based games, characters have a limited time to *freely move* within a set range before executing their chosen action, adding a layer of dynamic positioning to the strategy.
*   **Energy Management:** Master the energy system! You receive 3 energy per round. Carefully manage your resources to unleash powerful combos and abilities. Unused energy carries over to the next round (Overcharge), allowing for even stronger moves.
*   **Unique Characters:** Choose from four distinct classes, each with their own playstyle and strategic depth:
    *   **Titan (Tank):** A defensive powerhouse with AOE abilities.
    *   **Sage (Wizard/Healer):** A versatile support character with magic attacks and healing capabilities.
    *   **Hawk (Sniper):** A long-range specialist with precision strikes and evasive maneuvers.
    *   **Blaze (Fighter):** A fast and aggressive melee combatant with burning attacks.
*   **Strategic Card System:** Each character has a unique deck of skill cards. At the start of each round, you'll receive a random selection, forcing you to adapt your strategy on the fly. Card selection is *final* for the round, so choose wisely!
*   **Round-Based Matches:** Battles continue until one player's team is completely eliminated.
*   **Competitive Multiplayer:** Challenge other players in various modes:
    *   **1v1 Duels:** Test your skills in head-to-head combat.
    *   **Free-For-All (FFA):** Engage in chaotic battles with multiple opponents.
    *   **Ranked Matches:** Climb the leaderboards and prove your dominance.
*   **Blockchain & NFT Integration:**
    *   **Own Your Assets:** Collect unique characters, weapons, and skins as NFTs.
    *   **Play-to-Earn (P2E):** Earn in-game rewards through gameplay.
    *   **In-Game Marketplace:** Trade your NFTs with other players.

## Core Mechanics

### Game Flow

1.  **Pre-Phase Positioning:** Before the match begins, players have 30 seconds to strategically position their three characters on their side of the map.
2.  **Card Selection Phase:** At the start of each round, players receive a random selection of cards. You must choose *one* card per character. Once a card is selected, it *cannot* be changed for that round.
3.  **Turn-Based Combat with Free Movement:** The round begins, and characters act based on their speed stat. During their turn, a character can *move freely* within a set radius for a limited time *before* executing their selected card's action. This allows for dynamic positioning and adds a layer of real-time strategy to the turn-based combat.
4.  **New Cards:** After each round, players receive three new random cards to choose from for the next turn.

### Energy System

*   Players receive 3 energy per round.
*   Energy is used to play cards (attack, movement, defense).
*   Unused energy carries over to the next round (Overcharge), allowing for more powerful plays.
